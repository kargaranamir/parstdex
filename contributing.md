## How to contribute to Parstdex

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kargaranamir/parstdex/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kargaranamir/parstdex/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible or an **executable test case** demonstrating the 
expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the **fork-and-pull** Git workflow.

  - Fork the repo on GitHub
  - Clone the project to your own machine
  - Commit changes to your own branch
  - Push your work back up to your fork
  - Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

_NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!_

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
